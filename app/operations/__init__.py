# addition function 
def addition(a: Number, b: Number) -> Number:
    """
    This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
    
    Arguments:
    a -- The first number (float or int)
    b -- The second number (float or int)
    
    This function adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as it performs only one task: addition.
    
    Example:
    >>> addition(3, 4)
    7
    """
    return a + b  # Return the sum of a and b

# subtraction function
def subtraction(a: Number, b: Number) -> Number:
    """
    This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of subtracting b from a.
    
    Arguments:
    a -- The first number (float or int)
    b -- The second number (float or int)
    
    This function also adheres to SRP by focusing on the single task of subtraction.
    
    Example:
    >>> subtraction(10, 4)
    6
    """
    return a - b  # Return the result of a minus b

def multiplication(a: Number, b: Number) -> Number:
    """
    This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product.
    
    Arguments:
    a -- The first number (float or int)
    b -- The second number (float or int)
    
    Like the other functions, this follows SRP by handling only multiplication.
    
    Example:
    >>> multiplication(2, 5)
    10
    """
    return a * b  # Return the product of a and b

def division(a: Number, b: Number) -> Number:
    """
    This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of dividing a by b.
    
    Arguments:
    a -- The first number (float or int)
    b -- The second number (float or int)
    
    It is important to handle division by zero here to avoid runtime errors.
    A common way to handle this would be by catching ZeroDivisionError when used in a broader context.
    
    Example:
    >>> division(10, 2)
    5.0
    
    Potential Error:
    If b is 0, a ZeroDivisionError will occur. This could be handled using EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission)
    where you try the operation and handle the exception if it occurs.
    """
    return a / b  # Return the result of a divided by b
